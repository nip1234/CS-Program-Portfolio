# CS Program GitHub Portfolio

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio showcasing projects and assignments completed during my Computer Science coursework. It is designed to demonstrate my understanding and application of various programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and software development best practices.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this portfolio is to:

*   **Showcase Skills**: Highlight my abilities in C++, data structures (such as Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, and Linked Lists), algorithm design, and problem-solving.
*   **Track Progress**: Document my learning journey and the evolution of my programming skills throughout the course.
*   **Share Work**: Provide a centralized location for instructors and potential employers to review my academic projects.

## Projects Included

This portfolio will be updated with various projects as they are completed. Currently, it includes:

### Project Two: Course Advising Program

*   **Description**: A command-line application developed in C++ that assists academic advisors by managing and displaying course information.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Loads course data from a CSV file.
    *   Utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient storage and retrieval of course objects.
    *   Displays a sorted list of all courses in alphanumeric order.
    *   Allows users to search for specific courses and view their titles and prerequisites.
    *   Implements robust error handling and a user-friendly menu interface.
*   **Concepts Demonstrated**: Binary Search Trees, file I/O, string manipulation, algorithm design, and object-oriented programming principles.
